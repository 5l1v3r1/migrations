```bash
composer require doctrine/migrations
```

### Downloading the latest PHAR release

You can download the PHAR archive directly on [the release page](https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/releases).

### Building Your own Phar

Make sure Composer and all necessary dependencies are installed:

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

Build the PHAR archive:

```bash
./build-phar.sh
```

The `doctrine-migrations.phar` archive will now be present in the `build` directory.

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies run a Composer update command:

```bash
composer update
```

## Running the unit tests

To run the tests, you need the PDO SQLite extension for PHP.

Running the tests from the project root:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Happy testing :-)
